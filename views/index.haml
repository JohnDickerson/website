      Optimization for a 
    %p.lead
      I'm a Ph.D. student in computer science at Carnegie Mellon, advised by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/">Tuomas Sandholm</a> in the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~amem/">Electronic Marketplaces Lab</a>.

      I work at the intersection of computer science and economics, with a focus on solving <em>practical problems</em> using optimization and machine learning.  I'm currently the lead developer of the US nationwide <a href="/research#kidney">kidney exchange</a> program, and lead developer of a better way to   (currently in pilot phase with one of the nation's largest MSOs).

      I have published in <i><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/326/5957/1201">Science</a></i> magazine and been interviewed by <i><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=virtual-war-games">Scientific American</a></i>.  A project to which I contributed was covered by <i><a href="http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2009-12/scare-program-predicts-ied-weapons-caches-used-insurgents">Popular Science</a></i>, and featured in the journal <em><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110330/full/471566a.html">Nature</a></em>.  My <a href="http://www.oakland.edu/enp/">Erd&#246;s number</a> is 3.

      The popular tongue-in-cheek news site <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/27/pentagon_war_matrix/">The Register</a> describes me as a computer "boffin" (nerd) with "plans to create a lifelike virtual Matrix-style simulation of the entire world and human race."  I feel this is a bit ambitious, but appreciate the sentiment!</p>
