      Deploying machine learning models in adversarial environments with uncertain requirements.
    %p.lead
      I work at the intersection of machine learning and economics, with a focus on designing incentives that promote &quot;good&quot; participation in complex systems.

      I am co-founder and Chief Scientist at <a href="https://www.arthur.ai/">Arthur</a>, where we develop and deploy enterprise-grade AI systems.  I'm also a tenured professor of <a href="http://cs.umd.edu/">Computer Science</a> at the University of Maryland, with a joint appointment in the University of Maryland Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (<a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/">UMIACS</a>).  I hold a PhD in computer science from <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon</a>.  At Maryland, I am also formally affiliated with the Applied Mathematics &amp; Statistics, and Scientific Computation (<a href="http://amsc.umd.edu/">AMSC</a>) program, the Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory (<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/">HCIL</a>), and the Maryland Transportation Institute (<a href="https://mti.umd.edu/">MTI</a>).

If you're interested in building scalable monitoring solutions for AI systems, get in touch; <a href="https://www.arthur.ai/careers">we're hiring</a>!  I also actively advise, and more recently invest in, startups; I have a soft spot for UMD- and CMU-founded firms.  An example is <a href="https://govshop.publicspendforum.net/">GovShop</a>, which provides market intelligence to public sector buyers and suppliers. And, a while ago, I built the earliest allocation and pricing products at <a href="http://optimizedmarkets.com/">Optimized Markets</a>.

      The academic research that I have and continue to lead has been supported by an <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1846237&HistoricalAwards=false">NSF CAREER</a> award, as well as by current or recent grants from NIST, NSA, DARPA, ARPA-E, NIH (R01), NSF, and generous gifts from industry partners such as Google.  Previously, I was supported by a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fellowship">Facebook Fellowship</a> (2015&ndash;2017), <a href="http://www.siebelscholars.com/">Siebel Scholarship</a> (class of 2016), and an <a href="http://ndseg.asee.org/">NDSEG Fellowship</a> (2012&ndash;2015).  Recently, I've become involved with worldwide blood donation, primarily through a visiting research position at Facebook.  I've also been heavily involved in the world of organ allocation for more than a decade, primarily through the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS).

        <strong>Note to prospective PhD students:</strong>  The CS department at the University of Maryland admits students to the department itself, not to an individual advisor.  However, I will do my best to respond to inquiry emails.
