      I'm the lead developer of the US nationwide <a href="/research#kidney">kidney exchange</a> program, and lead developer of a better way to deal with TV advertisements (currently in the pilot phase with one of the nation's largest MSOs).

A project to which I contributed was covered by <em><a href="http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2009-12/scare-program-predicts-ied-weapons-caches-used-insurgents">Popular Science</a></em>, and featured in the journal <em><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110330/full/471566a.html">Nature</a></em>.

    /The popular tongue-in-cheek news site <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/11/27/pentagon_war_matrix/">The Register</a> describes me as a computer "boffin" (nerd) with "plans to create a lifelike virtual Matrix-style simulation of the entire world and human race."  I feel this is a bit ambitious, but appreciate the sentiment!</p>
